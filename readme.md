# Big Text Generator
This program will turn your text into a large ascii art quickly and efficiently.
Once it's generated the ascii art, it will put it into a text file located at C:\temp
The text file is overwritten after each use of the program.
Currently only supports letters, however I will probably add support for numbers and common symbols in the future.
Entering anything but letters will crash the program.
