# Big Text Generator
This program will turn your text into a large ascii art quickly and efficiently.
Once it's generated the ascii art, it will put it into a text file.
The text file is overwritten after each use of the program.
Currently only supports letters, however I will probably add support for numbers and common symbols in the future.
Entering anything but letters will hang the program.

# v1.2
Added support for numbers, spaces, exclamation marks, question marks, periods, and commas.

# v1.1
Changed where the text file is stored to fix the problem that occurs if you didn't have a temp folder on your C: drive.

# v1.0
Initial release
