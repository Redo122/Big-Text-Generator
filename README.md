# Big Text Generator
This program will turn your text into a large ascii art quickly and efficiently.<br/>
Once it's generated the ANSI art, it will put it into a text file.<br/>
The text file is overwritten after each use of the program. (Might change this.)<br/>
Currently only supports letters, numbers, and basic punctuation. (More characters coming in v1.3)<br/>
Entering anything but what's supported will hang the program. (Fixed in v1.3 coming soon)<br/>
Feel free to use the generated characters in whatever projects you want, just be sure to credit me :)

# v1.2
Added support for numbers, spaces, exclamation marks, question marks, periods, and commas.

# v1.1
Changed where the text file is stored to fix the problem that occurs if you didn't have a temp folder on your C: drive.

# v1.0
Initial release
