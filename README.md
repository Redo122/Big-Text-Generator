# Big Text Generator
This program will turn your text into a large ASCII art quickly and efficiently.<br/>
Once it's generated the ASCII art, it will put it into a text file.<br/>
The text file is overwritten after each use of the program. (Might change this.)<br/>
Currently only supports letters, numbers, and basic punctuation. (More characters coming in v1.3)<br/>
Entering anything but what's supported will hang the program. (Fixed in v1.3 coming soon)<br/>
Feel free to use the generated characters in whatever projects you want, just be sure to credit me :)<br/>
